### What are plant companionships and how do they work?

I was told to think of it as, friends for people, how our friends will help us and we'll help them. The same goes for plants! For example, the sunflowers sturdy stalks provide support for the cucumber vines, and the cucumbers big leaves shade the soil, keeping it moist and keeping weeds from growing. That is why sunflowers and cucumbers are great companions to have in your garden.
