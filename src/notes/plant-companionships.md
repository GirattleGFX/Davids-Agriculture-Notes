#### Definition

"Companionship Planting," the cultivation of different types of plants in close proximity so as to benefit each other, as planting a deer-repellent plant in a flower garden.

### What are plant companionships and how do they work?

I was told to think of it as, friends for people, how our friends will help us and we'll help them. The same goes for plants! For example, the sunflowers sturdy stalks provide support for the cucumber vines, and the cucumbers big leaves shade the soil, keeping it moist and keeping weeds from growing. That is why sunflowers and cucumbers are great companions to have in your garden.

"Companion planting is simply when two plants are grown close together for the benefit of one or both of those plants. So the benefit could go one way or be mutual. That could be as simple as growing nectar-rich flowers among crops to attract pollinators or two vegetables grown side by side to confuse or repel pests."

The three sisters trio is also a great example of companionship planting! Each of the sisters contributes something to the planting. Together, the sisters provide a balanced diet from a single planting. As older sisters often do, the corn offers the beans necessary support. The pole beans, the giving sister, pull nitrogen from the air and bring it to the soil for the benefit of all three. The Squash, helps keep weeds from growing around the beans and the corn because of their big leaves.
