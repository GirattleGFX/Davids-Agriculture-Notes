### What are raised beds?

A raised bed is usualy when a planting bed sits on top of your existing soil. The diference between this and regular gardening is usually the garden is directly on the ground, raised beds however is a few inches to as high as you need.

### Pros and cons for raised bed gardening

#### Pros:

##### 1. No tilling is better for the soil.

Instead of tilling up the soil from year to year to add fertilizer and amendments, gardeners usually maintain their raised beds by simply adding materials on top.

##### 2. Raised beds help keep out critters

Slugs can climb, but the tall sides of a raised garden box slow them down and provide an opportunity to stop them in their tracks. Many gardeners swear that slugs wonâ€™t crawl over copper flashing, which can border your box. You can also install hardware cloth on the bottom of the box to stop crawling critters like groundhogs from stealing root crops. And, because of their height, dogs are less likely to urinate directly on your plants.
